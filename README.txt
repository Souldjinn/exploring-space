This is my README file.
At this point 3/13/2014 I am very confused.
There are not enough diagrams to show the relationship
between computer, git, github, my website, and the
rest of everything I have learned so far. This is wack yo.
Hopefully in a few days I will understand git and how
to get it to work directly with my website, if thats even 
a thing.
