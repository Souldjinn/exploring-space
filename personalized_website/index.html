				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>I'm pretty multicultural. My father is Palestinian, and my mother is half white half Mexican. Over the years I've been immersed in several different cultures. As someone who has moved time and time again, I have an almost natural ability to adapt to the culture of my surroundings. Ive learned that even driving a few hours in any direction creates the possibility of finding a
				completely new sub-culture. These experiences have generated a mixture of emotions and lessons,
				but one thing I am sure of is that I have become a more understanding and empathetic human being
				as a result of these experiences. I dont know that this is directly important to my career as a programmer, but I have a feeling I will find a connection in the near future.</p>
